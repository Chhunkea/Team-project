## 🌐 Pages

- **`index.html`**: Main entry page
- **`/pages/homepage.html`**: Home page layout
- **`/pages/landingpage.html`**: Product or marketing landing page

---

## 🧱 Components

- **carousel.js**: Image slider logic
- **index.js**: Central component export or init

---

## 🎨 Styling (`/src/css/`)

Use the `:root` selector in CSS to define:

```css
/* Styling buttons */
button {
  background-color: #4CAF50;
  color: white;
  padding: 1rem;
  border: none;
  border-radius: 6px;
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

Apply these variables across the entire site to maintain consistency.

## 🧠 JavaScript (`/src/javascript/`)

Responsible for:

- DOM interactions
- Navigation toggles
- Dynamic content rendering
- Animations and effects
